<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Hi, this is the personal site of Jungjun (Peter) Go.
</p>

<h2>Work</h2>
<p>
  I work at Electronic Arts Korea as a Tier 3 System Engineer in the
  FIFA DevOps team. I'm part of a global follow-the-sun operations
  team (that includes on-call) and my duties include Linux sysadmin
  stuff, scripting in bash and Python, and ops-related development
  work. In the past I worked in the DevOps teams at Peertec Atto
  Research, and OSSLab, all in Seoul, Korea.
</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
  I've been a Linux guy since I first installed Ubuntu 8.04 Karmic on
  an old Asus Eee netbook. Since then I've cycled through Debian,
  Archlinux, Fedora, and now back to Ubuntu 19.04. I like tinkering
  with SBC's like the Raspberry Pi 3, upon which I'm running Archlinux
  ARM and I also enjoy playing with new open source technologies. I
  used to be involved in the Openstack Korea community, but haven't
  had time lately to get involved in the local opensource scene.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy coding in my free time and compete every year in Google Code
  Jam, Kickstart, and other coding competitions for fun. Although I've
  passed the GCJ Qualification Round every year for the past 5 years,
  I have yet to make it past Round 1. Before I die, this is one goal I
  want to achieve!
</p>

<p>
  I'm a whitebelt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and started in Dec. 2019. I'm
  also a fledgling Buddhist practitioner.
