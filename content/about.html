<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Hi, this is the personal site of Jungjun (Peter) Go.
</p>

<h2>Work</h2>
<p>
  I work at Electronic Arts Korea as a DevOps Engineer in FIFA
  DevOps. I'm part of a global follow-the-sun operations/SRE team with
  on-call rotation. My duties include incident response and
  troubleshooting, and development work for automation. In the past I
  worked in the DevOps teams at Peertec, Atto Research, and OSSLab in
  South Korea. <a href="../files/pj_resume_en-US.pdf">My

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
  I've been a Linux guy since I first installed Ubuntu 8.04 Karmic on
  an old Asus Eee netbook. Since then I've cycled through Debian,
  Archlinux, Fedora, and now back to Ubuntu. I like tinkering with
  SBC's like the Raspberry Pi 3, upon which I'm running Archlinux ARM
  and I also enjoy playing with new open source technologies. I used
  to be involved in the Openstack Korea community, but lately haven't had
  time to get involved in the local open source scene.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy coding in my free time and compete every year in Google Code
  Jam, Kickstart, and other coding competitions for fun. Although I've
  passed the GCJ Qualification Round every year for the past 5 years,
  I have yet to make it past Round 1. Before I die, this is one goal I
  want to achieve!
</p>

<p>
  I'm a whitebelt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and started in
  Dec. 2019. It's been about one year now and I've got a single
  stripe ;) I'm also a fledgling Buddhist practitioner.
